Wallpaper-Vomit-Twitter-Bot
===========================

Regurgitates wallpapers posted on 4chan's /wg/ board.

Requirements:

Twython
Sqlite3
HTMLParser
Twitter Application with keys
Somewhere about 500MB of space for storing the images.


How to use it:

Run main.py first
It will download all the images from the 10 pages of 4chan /wg/
It doesn't dig into each thread so it's not a monstrous amount of media download.

Use your keys in twitterwrapper.py and then run it. 

Enjoy!
